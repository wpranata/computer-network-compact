Ethernet Cable
==============
An Ethernet cable is a common type of network cable used with wired networks.
Ethernet cables connect devices such as PCs, routers, and switches within a local area network.

These physical cables are limited by length and durability.
If a network cable is too long or of poor quality, it won't carry a good network signal.
These limits are one reason there are different types of Ethernet cables that are optimized to perform certain tasks in specific situations.
