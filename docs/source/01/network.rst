Computer Network
================

Simply speaking, a **computer network** is **a set of connected devices**.

Types of computer networks by scope
-----------------------------------

PAN (Personal Area Network)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the smallest and most basic network that you'll find. It's meant to cover a very small area.

A PAN is most commonly used for one individual and to connect just a handful of devices such as a computer, smart phone, and printer.

PANs typically do not include Routers, since the network scope is very small, with a small device count.

Common examples include:

- Bluetooth
- Direct cable connection

LAN (Local Area Network)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a LAN connects a group of computers or devices together across a local area.

This type of network can be utilized to connect devices throughout one building or even 2-3 buildings depending on the proximity to each other.  

Common examples include:

- Apartment Wi-Fi
- Office Wi-Fi
- LAN Party

.. note::

    The wireless counterpart of a LAN is called ``WLAN`` (Wireless Local Area Network)

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MAN connects multiple LANs together and spans an entire geographical area.

Ownership and management can be handled by a single person, but it's more likely done by a larger company or organization.

Common examples include:

- Campus network
- Interconnected office networks

WAN (Wide Area Network)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WAN connects multiple devices across an even larger area, up until the whole globe.

WAN is so wide, it requires multiple organizations to manage and handle the network.

A common example of WAN is **the Internet**.
